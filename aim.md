Sorting is a fundamental task in computing. There are several sorting algorithms developed decades ago, but new algorithms continue to appear. In this experiment, the focus is to study a few classical sorting algorithms.  

We will primarily be using arrays for our algorithms as it is simple and illustrative to do so. we will cover merge sort, insertion sort, and quick sort in this experiment.
